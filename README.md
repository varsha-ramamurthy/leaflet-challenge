GeoMapping Homework Assignment

## Step 1

- Data was pulled from the USGS website to plot all M2.5+ earthquakes from the past 30 days and visualize it on a map
- A color-coded legend was appropriately designed to indicate which colors correspond to the appropriate magnitude earthquakes

## Step 2

- Data on tectonic plates was pulled from GitHub and visualized using lines while the earthquake plots from step 1 remained along with the legend
